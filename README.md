# Framework Toolkit

A toolkit for preparing data, extracting information, and fine-tuning subsymbolic AI models for integration into hybrid AI applications. Contains both general-purpose tools and application-specific implementations.

> Note: While some components like Model Tools, Fine-Tuning, PII Removal, and parts of Information Extraction are relatively general-purpose, the data preparation and dataset building modules are highly customized for my specific application. These customized components serve best as implementation examples rather than reusable libraries.

## Overview

This repository contains a mixed collection of tools across the data preparation and model fine-tuning pipeline. The more generalized components (model tools, fine-tuning, PII removal) can be adapted for various use cases, while the data preparation and dataset building modules demonstrate how I implemented these steps for my specific application needs. Together, they showcase a complete workflow from raw data to deployable fine-tuned LLMs for hybrid AI systems.

## Components

### PII Removal

A more general-purpose tool for identifying and removing personally identifiable information (PII) from datasets:

- Automated detection of sensitive information
- Configurable redaction strategies
- Support for multiple languages
- Compliance with privacy regulations

### Model Tools

General-purpose utilities for working with and manipulating AI models:

- Model conversion between different formats
- Quantization tools for model compression
- Performance benchmarking
- Integration helpers for various deployment environments

### Data Preparation

> Note: These tools are highly customized for my specific application and primarily serve as implementation examples. They demonstrate how I approached data preparation for my domain, but would require significant modification for other use cases.

Tools for preprocessing and transforming raw data:

- Text normalization and cleaning
- Data validation and error detection
- Format conversion utilities
- Contextual data enrichment

### Information Extraction

> Note: While containing some generalizable techniques, this module is tailored to my application's specific data structures and requirements.

Tools designed for creating specialized fine-tuning datasets for different tasks:

- Named entity recognition data preparation
- Text classification dataset creation
- Question-answering pair generation
- Semantic relationship extraction

### Dataset Building

> Note: This module is closely tied to my application's domain and data formats. It serves best as an implementation reference rather than a reusable library.

Utilities for constructing instruction-following datasets:

- JSONL file generation for fine-tuning tasks
- Instruction template management
- Data augmentation capabilities
- Quality assurance tools for dataset validation

### Fine-Tuning

A more general-purpose Erlang-to-PyTorch bridge for model fine-tuning:

- ErlPort integration for seamless Elixir/Python interoperability
- JSON-based configuration for fine-tuning parameters
- Support for various optimization strategies
- Checkpoint management and evaluation metrics

## Getting Started

Some component include their own README with specific installation and usage instructions. Most components are implemented as standalone Elixir applications with appropriate dependencies.

> **Important:** Many tools in this framework rely on ErlPort for Elixir-Python integration. Proper setup of Python paths and environment variables is required for these components to function correctly. Make sure your Python environment contains all the necessary dependencies and is correctly configured in your system PATH.

```bash
# Example: To use the fine-tuning module
cd fine_tuning
mix deps.get
mix compile
```
